DVC (Data Version Control)
This is a simple implementation of a Data Version Control (DVC) system, built to manage and track changes in data files, supporting features like branching, committing, merging, and diffing, similar to a version control system for source code.

Features
Repository Initialization: Initialize a DVC repository with basic metadata.
File Staging & Committing: Stage and commit files with their respective hashes.
Branching: Create new branches and switch between them.
Merging: Merge changes from one branch into another, with automatic conflict detection.
Diffing: View differences between commits.
File Ignoring: Add files to .dvcignore to prevent them from being tracked.
Cloning: Clone the repository to another directory.
Commit History: View commit history for a given branch.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
unittest for running tests (used for testing functionality of the DVC system)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [project url]
cd dvc
(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have any specific dependencies, list them in this file
Usage
Initializing a Repository
To initialize a new DVC repository, use the following command:

python
Copy code
from sourcecontrol import DVC

repo = DVC('path_to_your_repo')
repo.init()
This will create the necessary directories (.dvc, objects, etc.) for tracking files.

Adding and Committing Files
To stage and commit files, use the following methods:

python
Copy code
repo.add('path_to_your_file.txt')  # Add file to staging area
repo.commit('Initial commit')  # Commit staged files with a message
Creating Branches
To create a new branch, use the following method:

python
Copy code
repo.branch('new-branch')  # Create a new branch
repo.checkout('new-branch')  # Switch to the new branch
Merging Branches
To merge one branch into another:

python
Copy code
repo.merge('new-branch')  # Merge 'new-branch' into the current branch
Viewing Commit History
You can view commit history for the current branch with the following method:

python
Copy code
repo.log()
Diffing Between Commits
To see the differences between two commits:

python
Copy code
repo.diff('commit_id_1', 'commit_id_2')
Ignoring Files
You can ignore specific files by adding them to the .dvcignore file. Once ignored, the files will not be staged or tracked.

python
Copy code
# .dvcignore
ignored_file.txt
Cloning a Repository
To clone a repository:

python
Copy code
repo.clone('path_to_clone')  # Clone the repository to a new location
Testing
To run the tests for this project, you can use the built-in unittest framework. In the project directory, run:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover
This will run all the test cases and display the results in the terminal.

Example Usage
Here is a basic example of how to use the DVC system:

python
Copy code
from sourcecontrol import DVC

# Initialize the repository
repo = DVC('my_repo')
repo.init()

# Add a file and commit
repo.add('test_file.txt')
repo.commit('Initial commit')

# Create a new branch and switch to it
repo.branch('feature-branch')
repo.checkout('feature-branch')

# Commit changes on the feature branch
repo.add('test_file.txt')
repo.commit('Feature commit')

# Merge the feature branch back to the main branch
repo.checkout('main')
repo.merge('feature-branch')

# View commit history
repo.log()

# Diff between commits
repo.diff('commit_id_1', 'commit_id_2')
